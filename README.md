# Scotland Yard Board Game

 Team of two students. This is the full coursework for the Object Orientated Programming course, in my first year of university. It simulates the Scotland Yard board game.
- A GUI skeleton was given. All the logic was implemented by the students
- The implemented AI makes use of a breadth-first search algorithm to look across the board and make decisions.
